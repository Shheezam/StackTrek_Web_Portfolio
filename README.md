1. The html file is the 'web portfolio'
2. The main css file is the style.css file and the other css files are for responsive scripts.
3. I used some help from JS to build a better output.
4. Note that on my local, the images and videos I used have a folder, but here, they are not in a folder.
5. There are videos that exceeded the uplodable limit size ,so I cloned and commit first on bash to upload it here. 
6. Before running the script, just make sure that all the files are created, stored, and called in the code properly.
